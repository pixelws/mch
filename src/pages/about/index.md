title: About Mast Cell Hope
---
Mast Cell Hope was built out of a desire to improve the suffering of mast cell patients. We need better treatments and a cure.

We are a non-profit, all volunteer organization. We are driven by our mission and most of us have been in the mast cell community for over twenty years. We understand the devastating toll this disease takes on families and we want to end that.

We have lofty goals and big ideas. We are an action oriented group and we hope that you will join us.

### Achieving Goals
Research is the way to achieve our goals and that takes a lot of funding.
We strive to follow up on current research, create a genome study and be at the forefront of future research around the world.

### Helping Through Education
Unfortunately, our diseases are rare and difficult to diagnose. Our educational goal is to offer continuing education courses for Emergency Department staff and General Practitioners.  Our long term goal is to offer educational training to all medical professionals.
