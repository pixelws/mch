    It is our aim to share knowledge of mast cell diseases with healthcare professionals and provide education to all medical fields.  This will help spread awareness of our diseases and improve patient outcomes. Having knowledgable staff leads to better patient care.

### Continuing Education
Mast Cell Hope is always working on creating and offering continuing education credits to medical professionals. It is our intention to better the experiences of patients when visiting the Emergency Department, General Practitioners, Hospital and Specialists. We will also be creating courses for nurses and other vital medical staff.  Medical personnel who are educated about the triggers, sensitivities, and treatments for Mast Cell patients are more likely to treat us with understanding and proper medical interventions.

### Conferences
We will also be attending Professional Conferences to further the promotion of our Mast Cell Community and the courses we offer.
