### Continuing Education
Mast Cell Hope will be creating and offering continuing education credits to medical professionals. It is our intention to better the experiences of patients when visiting the Emergency Department, General Practitioners, Hospital and Specialists. We will also be creating courses for nurses and other vital medical staff.

Medical personnel who are educated about the triggers, sensitivities, and treatments for Mast Cell patients are more likely to treat us with understanding and proper medical interventions. This will help spread awareness of our diseases as well as improve patient outcomes.

### Conferences
We will also be attending Professional Conferences to further the promotion of our Mast Cell Community and the courses we offer.
